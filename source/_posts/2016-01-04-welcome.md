Welcome to the Python Data Web Programming class at The Iron Yard. We hope you are as
excited to be joining us as we are to be teaching you. It is time to
start getting ready for the class and get a glimpse at what the next few
months have in store for you and your classmates. Here are some things you need
to get squared away before we kick off in a few weeks:

* [Get and setup your Mac](/setup/)
* [Complete your prework](/prework/)


The prework is not trivial so you need to get started as soon as possible to
give yourself enough time before you start on February 15th.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me before the class
begins.
